# FIzzbuzz

This is a small program written in asp.net framework with razor
this is my first time using razor but i must say that it is really easy to use

This is a popular challange that will print the numbers from 1 to 100 whereby a multiple of 3 will rpint "Fizz" and a multiple of 5 will print "Buzz" and the multiple of both will print out 'FizzBuzz'

The extra flavor i added is that the code will ask the user for the multiple that they want to change for Fizz or Buzz or boths
